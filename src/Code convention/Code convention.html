            <h3>Java Code Convention</h3>
        </header>
        <main>
            <p>The Java code conventions are defined by Oracle in the coding conventions document.</p>
            <p>It is important to get used to and follow coding conventions, so that code written by multiple programmers will appear the same. Projects may re-define the standard code conventions to better fit their needs. Examples include a list of allowed abbreviations, as these can often make the code difficult to understand for other designers. Documentation should always accompany code.</p>
            <p>One example from the coding conventions is how to define a constant. Constants should be written with capital letters in Java, where the words are separated by an underscore ('_') character. In the Java coding conventions, a constant is a static final field in a class.</p>
            <p>The reason for this diversion is that Java is not 100% object-oriented and discerns between "simple" and "complex" types. These will be handled in detail in the following sections. An example for a simple type is the byte type. An example for a complex type is a class. A subset of the complex types are classes that cannot be modified after creation, like a String, which is a concatenation of characters.</p>
            <p>For instance, consider the following "constants":</p>
            <pre>
                <code>
                        public class MotorVehicle {
                        /** Number of motors */
                        private static final int MOTORS = 1;

                        /** Name of a motor */
                        private static final String MOTOR_NAME = "Mercedes V8";

                        /** The motor object */
                        private static final Motor THE_MOTOR = new MercedesMotor();

                        /**
                        * Constructor
                        */
                        public MotorVehicle() {
                        MOTORS = 2;                     // Gives a syntax error as MOTORS has already been assigned a value.
                        THE_MOTOR = new ToshibaMotor(); // Gives a syntax error as THE_MOTOR has already been assigned a value.
                        MOTOR_NAME.toLowercase();       // Does not give a syntax error, because it returns a new String rather than editing the MOTOR_NAME variable.
                        THE_MOTOR.fillFuel(20.5);       // Does not give a syntax error, as it changes a variable in the motor object, not the variable itself.
                        }
                        }
                    </code>
