                <h3>Java Origins And Evolution</h3>
            </header>

            <p>The very first beta release of Java dates back to 1995. At its launch, the tech community considered Java
                the future language of enterprises, and this has proven to be true.</p>
            <p>Java was initially developed by Sun Microsystems and then bought in 2009 by Oracle. Today, Java builds
                are available as a proprietary option by Oracle and as an open-source build called OpenJDK. The
                open-source approach helps to improve the code and deliver more enhancements and bug fixes than can be
                done by a single organization with limited resources. As a result, the code is being developed and
                released rapidly, especially after moving to a new release model. The long-time support versions are set
                to come out every two years.</p>

                <h3>Common Terms Defined</h3>
            </header>

            <p>The Java Language Specification (JLS) is a technical reference that defines the code structure and
                syntaxis, including the important components such as the Java Development Kit (JDK), Java virtual
                machine (JVM) and Java Runtime Environment (JRE).
            <p/>

            <dl>
                <dt>JVM</dt>
                <dd>
                    A Java virtual machine (JVM) is a virtual machine that enables a computer to run Java programs as
                    well as programs written in other languages that are also compiled to Java bytecode. The JVM is
                    detailed by a specification that formally describes what is required in a JVM implementation. Having
                    a specification ensures interoperability of Java programs across different implementations so that
                    program authors using the Java Development Kit (JDK) need not worry about idiosyncrasies of the
                    underlying hardware platform.
                </dd>
                <dt>JDK</dt>
                <dd>
                    The Java Development Kit (JDK) is a distribution of Java Technology by Oracle Corporation. It
                    implements the Java Language Specification (JLS) and the Java Virtual Machine Specification (JVMS)
                    and provides the Standard Edition (SE) of the Java Application Programming Interface (API). It is
                    derivative of the community driven OpenJDK which Oracle steward.[5] It provides software for working
                    with Java applications. Examples of included software are the virtual machine, a compiler,
                    performance monitoring tools, a debugger, and other utilities that Oracle considers useful for a
                    Java programmer.
                </dd>
                <dt>JRE</dt>
                <dd>
                    The Java Runtime Environment (JRE) released by Oracle is a freely available software distribution
                    containing a stand-alone JVM (HotSpot), the Java standard library (Java Class Library), a
                    configuration tool, and—until its discontinuation in JDK 9—a browser plug-in. It is the most common
                    Java environment installed on personal computers in the laptop and desktop form factor. Mobile
                    phones including feature phones and early smartphones that ship with a JVM are most likely to
                    include a JVM meant to run applications targeting Micro Edition of the Java platform. Meanwhile,
                    most modern smartphones, tablet computers, and other handheld PCs that run Java apps are most likely
                    to do so through support of the Android operating system, which includes an open source virtual
                    machine incompatible with the JVM specification. (Instead, Google's Android development tools take
                    Java programs as input and output Dalvik bytecode, which is the native input format for the virtual
                    machine on Android devices.)

                <h3>Java Tools And Frameworks</h3>
            </header>

            <p>The Java frameworks allow for easier development of particular applications; among them are Spring Boot,
                Quarkus, Micronaut and many more.</p>
            <p>The Java community has always been known for its modernized approach. As a consequence of this ongoing
                work, Java continues to be an essential choice to develop robust, scalable and multitiered applications
                for any business requirements.</p>
            <p>Currently, there are several important initiatives at work to improve the Java platform and environment:
                ​​
                <mark>the Panama Project</mark>
                , which aims to make Java more compatible with libraries written in other languages;
                <mark>the Loom Project</mark>
                that will boost multithreading;
                <mark>the Amber Project</mark>
                , which has the goal of changing Java code in a way that will increase a developer's productivity; and
                many other projects.
